# Welcome to Train Rush VR #

Train Rush is a VR Experience where you as the player take the role of a steam train conductor delivering precious cargo through a vast desert to the next station that is 6 minutes away. 
The trouble is that the local gang of outlaws has caught wind of this and are on the offensive.
Normally protecting a train would be no simple task but through the power of modern technology, your train has been equipped with powerful cannons to blow your foes away. 
You won't be alone though, your friendly little helper doll will help you defeat your foes, upgrade your train using the handy upgrade shop included in your train and feed your train coal to reach your destination unharmed.
